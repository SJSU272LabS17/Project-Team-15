Team Project Ideas :

1) Problem Statement : Sentiment Analysis of a Topic using IBM Watson Conversation
Abstract of the Idea : The project focuses on generating a report which will provide an analysis of common public survey of any prevailing topic around the web. The context of the sentiment analysis could be anything from an election poll to a new device launch. It will be a review of the project not in words, but in sentiments. So, in a case where context is new devices launched and the parameter i.e.the sentiment is happiness so for example if iphone 7s makes people happier than samsung galaxy s8 then we have a clear winner using the sentiment analysis. The project will be based on a cloud application developed using the IBM bluemix cloud services and platform, and it will extract the analysis using the IBM's new era Watson Technology.

2) Problem Statement :  A mobile dashboard (android tablet) to control all connected IoT devices in the house.
Abstract of the Idea : This dashboard should allow control of lights, toaster oven, music player, thermostat or anything else connected via wifi in the house.
