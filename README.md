Team Project Ideas:

**1.Sentiment analysis of any news using Alchemy API: **
An API that does sentiment analysis of a dataset of news and blogs over web. The context of the sentiment analysis could be anything from an election poll to a new device launch. The project aims at analyzing context from some trusted sources like DBPedia(as used by WATSON)  over latest period of time(say last 20 days) and generating an output as positive, negative or neutral sentiments . The output also includes as how the sentiments have changed over a period of time (like trend analysis). This is put in the form of a dashboard that has more readable forms like pie charts or graphs. The project will be based on a cloud application developed using the IBM bluemix cloud services and platform, and it will extract the analysis using the IBM's new era Watson Technology. 
Extensions: Integrating other APIs like speech to text over our service to achieve added functionalities.

**2.Smartchat **
This is a chat application that analyses your chat conversations to give you insights about your emotions, personality and provides summary of the chat. The summary section can help user to quickly grasp the context of the chat and need not go through each text conversation. The chatbox can be divided into number of sections- chat window, summary, emotions. The emotion outcomes can be expressed as emoji expressions (as in whatsapp).
Technologies: Smartchat uses Watson services such as tone analyzer, personality analyzer, alchemy language API to give you insight about your text.

**3. A mobile dashboard to control all connected IoT devices in the house.**
Abstract of the Idea : This dashboard should allow control of lights, toaster oven, music player, thermostat or anything else connected via wifi in the house.
